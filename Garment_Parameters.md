Related Parameters:

- **Adhesion**  
  Range: [0, inf)  
  A higher value indicates stronger adhesion between particles and objects (rigid or deformable), making them more likely to stick together.

- **Adhesion Offset Scale**  
  Range: [0, inf)  
  A higher value increases the effective range of adhesion.

- **Cohesion** (primarily affects fluids)  
  Range: [0, inf)  
  Cohesion represents the attraction between particles, helping them maintain a cohesive shape. Higher values result in stronger attraction, which can make fluids appear jelly-like if set too high.

- **Particle Adhesion Scale**  
  Range: [0, inf)  
  Controls the adhesion force between solid particles.

- **Particle Friction Scale**  
  Range: [0, inf)  
  Controls the friction between solid particles.

- **Drag**  
  Range: [0, inf)  
  Determines the resistance an object experiences from air or fluid. Higher values cause faster speed decay.

- **Lift**  
  Range: [0, inf)  
  Controls the lift force generated by an object in a fluid or air. Higher values increase lift.

- **Friction**  
  Range: [0, inf)  
  Controls friction between particles and rigid or deformable objects. Higher values increase friction.

- **Damping**  
  Range: [0, inf)  
  Controls the decay of particle velocity.  
  Higher damping -> Faster stabilization, reduced oscillation (ideal for high-friction or viscous objects).  
  Lower damping -> Prolonged motion, maintaining dynamic effects (ideal for lightweight objects or fluids).

- **Gravity Scale**  
  Range: (-inf, inf)  
  Scales the effect of gravity. A value of -1.0 reverses gravity, useful for simulating lightweight inflatable objects like balloons.

- **Viscosity**  
  Range: [0, inf)  
  Controls internal friction in fluids, determining their thickness (high viscosity = thick, low viscosity = thin).

- **Vorticity Confinement**  
  Range: [0, inf)  
  Simulates fluid vortices.  
  Higher values -> Rapidly rotating fluids (e.g., stormy air or swirling water).  
  Lower values -> Smoother fluid flow.

- **Surface Tension**  
  Range: [0, inf)  
  Higher values -> Fluid particles bond more tightly, creating calmer surfaces with fewer ripples or breaks.  
  Lower values -> Surfaces become unstable, prone to rippling and breaking.
